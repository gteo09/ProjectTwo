# ProjectTwo

This app allows users to create a personal wish list of movies to watch.

The user is presented with a checklist of movies, organized by genres, subgenres, runtimes, and so forth. This will return movie suggestions from OMDB. They user can then mark the movies they wish to add to their list, or indicate movies to exclude from future searches.
