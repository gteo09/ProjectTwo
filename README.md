This app allows users to create personalized watchlists of movies and tv shows.

On login, the user may browse, add to, or delete from custom watchlists they previously created, or make new watchlists under a category of their choosing.

To create a new watchlist or add to an existing one, the user has the option to enter a search term in a field then submit it to the TMDB movie API. This will return a list of movie titles that they can either (a) add to a new category, (b) add to an existing cateory, or (c) discard. 

If a user wishes to browse watchlists they have already established, they can click on a category and be taken to a page that displays movie posters of all films in that category. They can click on any individual poster to see more information on that particular movie, such as the title, release date, director, actors, and a synopsis.
